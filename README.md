# SharpCollection
Nightly builds of common C# offensive tools, fresh from their respective master branches built and released in a CDI fashion using Azure DevOps release pipelines. 

# Azure DevOps? 
Each night at 03:00 AM, the Azure DevOps pipeline checks for new commits to all repositories master branch. Branches with changes will be automatically fetched and compiled with different framework targets as well as architectures, before being pushed to this repo. 

The pipeline can be found here:
